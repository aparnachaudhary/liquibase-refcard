=== How it works: ===

The main file for the content is 'src/slides/content/refcard.asciidoc'. It loads include files from the 'src/slides/content/asciidoc' folder. The refcard is available in HTML5 format and you can also print a 2 column layout. 

.The refcard has three sections:
* +Overview:+ Summarizes Liquibase philosophy and features
* +Configuration:+ Explains how to use maven plugin for different operations
* +Commands:+ Provides information on all the change elements (e.g. insert, createTable, etc) supported by Liquibase and their rollback capability
