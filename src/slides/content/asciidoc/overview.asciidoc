1+| Liquibase Philosophy
|
Liquibase, is an Apache Licensed open source library written in Java for tracking, managing and applying database changes. +
 +
All changes to the database are stored in XML files and identified by a combination of an "id" and "author" tag as well as the 
name of the file itself. A list of all applied changes is stored in each database which is consulted on all database updates 
to determine what new changes need to be applied. As a result, there is no database version number but this approach allows 
it to work in environments with multiple developers and code branches.

2+| CONCEPTS
| Changelog file | Developers store database changes in text-based files on their local development machines and apply them to their local databases.
| Change Set | Change Sets are uniquely identified by the "author" and "id" attribute along with with the location of the changelog file and are the units Liquibase tracks execution of.
| Changes | Each changeset generally contains a change which describes the change/refactoring to apply to the database. Liquibase supports both descriptive changes that generate SQL for supported databases and raw SQL.
| Preconditions | Preconditions can be applied to either the changelog as a whole or individual change sets. If a precondition fails, Liquibase will stop execution.
| Contexts | Contexts can be applied to changesets to control which are ran in different environments. For example, some changesets can be tagged as "production" and others as "test". If no context is specified, the changeset will run regardless of the execution context

1+| Best Practices
|

- Avoid multiple changes per changeset to avoid failed autocommit statements that can leave the database in an unexpected state.
- Partition the changelog. Instead of creating one huge changelog per application; create smaller sub-changelogs and use the include script statement to link these into the Master changelog.
- Maintain separate changelog for Stored Procedures and use +runOnChange="true"+. This flag forces LiquiBase to check if the Changeset was changed instead of just checking if it was run once before so it can be skipped.
- Try to write changesets in a way that they can be rolled back. e.g. use liquibase relevant change clause over +<sql>+.
- Include a +<rollback>+ clause whenever a change  doesn't support out of box rollback.
- Always include a +<preconditions>+ clause in critical changes e.g. before dropping a table it could be wise to check if the table has any data.
- Use +comments+ in the change sets. They say "A stitch in time saves nine"!
- Do not ever +edit+ a changeset (exceptions: +<rollback>+ script, error handling, +<sql>+ tags with +runOnChange="true"+)
- Leverage Liquibase to manage your Reference Data.
